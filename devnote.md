# Developer Notes

This is a journal of events of developing this extension.

## Initial thoughts

Prior to the inception of the project, I encountered a problem when doing my basketball analysis project. I wanted to compare output of a chart when I ran the second time after meaking edit. I could do this because every time I ran the cell it cleared the last output. Since I did not save the image, I could tell the difference. So this is how this idead came to be. Create an extension that caches the output so that can be able to go back the previous outputs.

This is an oppotunity to learn how to build jupyterlab extensions.
